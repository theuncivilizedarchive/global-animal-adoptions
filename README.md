## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is intended **only to promote animal adoptions**.  
All content belongs to the original shelters and organizations.

## 🏠 How to Add Your Shelter

If you manage an animal shelter, rescue group, or foster network and would like your adoption posts to appear on **Global Animal Adoptions**, you’re very welcome to join.

### ✅ Preferred Option: RSS Feed
The easiest way to be included is to provide a **public RSS feed** that contains your adoption listings.

Examples:
- WordPress sites usually have a feed at `/feed`
- Dedicated adoption platforms often provide RSS automatically

Please make sure:
- The feed contains **real adoption posts**
- Each post has a **title, description, and link**
- Images are included if possible (optional but recommended)

---

### 🌐 Websites Without RSS
If your website does **not** provide an RSS feed but has a public page listing adoptable animals, it can still be included using **HTML scraping**.

In this case, please provide:
- The exact URL of the adoption page
- Confirmation that scraping is allowed by your website’s terms
- A consistent page structure (list of animals, profiles, etc.)

---

### 🚫 What Is Not Accepted
To keep the channel clean and useful, the following are **not included**:
- Blog posts or technical updates
- News articles or announcements
- Fundraising-only posts
- Event-only pages

The bot automatically filters non-adoption content.

---

### 📩 How to Request Inclusion

To request adding your shelter, please:
- Open a **GitHub Issue** in this repository  
  **or**
- Contact the project owner via email 📧 **angela.rossi393@gmail.com**

Include:
- Shelter name
- Website URL
- RSS feed URL (if available)
- Country
- Species you handle (dogs, cats, others)
